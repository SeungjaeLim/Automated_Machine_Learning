# ex09-NAS1
   
        In this exercise you will learn how to run your NAS optimization algorithms on NAS-Bench-101. 
        To avoid that you waste too much time training the sampled architectures, we will not optimize the actual benchmark but instead use a tabular benchmark. 
        Refer to "NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search" for more details about the search space and encoding.
